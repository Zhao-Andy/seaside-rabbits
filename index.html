        <strong>Seaside Rabbits is a not-for-profit volunteer service which helps rabbits rescued from meat or fur farms to
        <br>loving, indoor lives as family pets.</strong> Seaside Rabbits is not a shelter. Healthy, non-aggressive,
        <br> spayed/neutered animals, who have potential to be great pets are identified. These animals have been
        <br>rescued. Usually they are afraid of people and have no idea of how to live in an indoor home.

        When Seaside takes a rabbit, it is carefully checked by an exotics vet, then brought to a home. It learns to
    <br>socialize with people and stays for as many months as it needs to become adoptable. When the right
    <br>adopter is found, the bunny goes to its new home.

      Seaside Rabbits also gives small group education on house rabbit care, and provides support for rescued
    <br>farm rabbits currently in shelters.
