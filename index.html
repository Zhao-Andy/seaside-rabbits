        Seaside Rabbits is a not-for-profit volunteer service which helps rabbits rescued from meat or fur farms to
        loving, indoor lives as family pets. Seaside Rabbits is not a shelter. Healthy, non-aggressive,
         spayed/neutered animals, who have potential to be great pets are identified. These animals have been
        rescued. Usually they are afraid of people and have no idea of how to live in an indoor home.
   </p>

        When Seaside takes a rabbit, it is carefully checked by an exotics vet, then brought to a home. It learns to
    socialize with people and stays for as many months as it needs to become adoptable. When the right
    adopter is found, the bunny goes to its new home.
    </p>

      Seaside Rabbits also gives small group education on house rabbit care, and provides support for rescued
    farm rabbits currently in shelters.
